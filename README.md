# Capitalizer

This repository builds a LC-3 assembly program that echoes and capitalizes a given string.

## Description

LC-3 assembly is a computer educational programming language to explain the functioning of low-level programming language. Although this script is fairly long, it aims to echo a string and capitalize it. This shows how much work high-level languages - like Python - have to do to make such tasks way easier.

Make sure to read the comments in the code to see the role of each register, and understand the job of each loop in getting characters in our string, and then mimic them.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

You will need a LC-3 compiler to run this code. A free online version can be found at https://wchargin.com/lc3web/.
Click on Assemble and paste the code. Then, hit run and you should see the prompt in the console. Enter your input and press enter key.

The result should look like this:

Try to run the program line-by-line to understand better the functioning of assembly routines and register.
